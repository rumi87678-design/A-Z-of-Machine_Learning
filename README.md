# A-Z of Machine Learning is a comprehensive hands-on project designed to help beginners and intermediate learners understand, implement, and experiment with various machine learning algorithms. The project covers both regression and classification techniques, including classical methods and ensemble learning, as well as an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The goal of this project is to provide a practical toolkit for experimenting with machine learning algorithms on real datasets while learning core concepts such as model evaluation, overfitting, underfitting, and gradient descent. There are several sections. Such as:

Linear Regression: Predict continuous numerical values using real-world datasets. Logistic Regression: Classify categorical outcomes (e.g., survival prediction). k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): Simple and intuitive classification algorithm. Support Vector Machine (SVM): Class separation using hyperplanes. Decision Tree: Hierarchical decision-making for classification tasks. Random Forest: Ensemble learning for improved accuracy. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Text classification with preprocessing and feature extraction. Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and accuracy for model performance analysis

Each folder contains: A Python implementation of the algorithm Example datasets Visualization of results (charts, graphs) Notes on model evaluation and performance
