#A–Z of Machine Learning (Foundational Practice)

Overview
This repository contains my foundational practice in Machine Learning, implemented in Python. The goal of this work was learning core algorithms from scratch-level understanding, using small, well-known datasets to understand how models behave, how data affects predictions, and how evaluation works in practice. This repository is not a research project and not domain-specific. It represents my early-stage training in data analysis and machine learning, which I later intend to apply in more specialized fields.


What This Repository Covers:

 I implemented and experimented with the following core machine learning algorithms:
  Logistic Regression – binary classification and probability-based decision making,
  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – distance-based classification and sensitivity to noise,
  Support Vector Machine (SVM) – margin-based classification for high-dimensional data,
  Random Forest – ensemble learning and feature importance analysis.
 
Each notebook focuses on:
  data preprocessing,
  model training,
  basic evaluation,
  understanding strengths and limitations of the algorithm.

Datasets Used:
 To focus on learning algorithms rather than collecting data, I used standard public datasets:
  Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset: Used to explore prediction of a medical outcome based on health-related features such as glucose level, BMI, and age,
  Titanic Dataset (CSV / TSV): Used to practice feature selection, handling missing data, and classification logic,
  Bike Buyers Dataset: Used for classification and pattern recognition in structured tabular data.
These datasets were chosen only for educational purposes.


Purpose of This Work

This repository represents:
  my first structured exposure to machine learning,
  development of analytical thinking and data handling skills.
I consider this work a learning foundation, not a finished or advanced project.

This repository is intended for learning and practice only. It does not represent professional-level machine learning, medical advice, or research-grade analysis.
