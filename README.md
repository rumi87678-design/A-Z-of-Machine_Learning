**A–Z-of-Machine_Learning (Foundational Practice)**


**Overview**

This repository contains my foundational practice in Machine Learning, implemented in Python. The goal of this work was learning core algorithms from scratch-level understanding, using small, well-known datasets to understand how models behave, how data affects predictions, and how evaluation works in practice. This repository is not a research project and not domain-specific. It represents my early-stage training in data analysis and machine learning, which I later intend to apply in more specialized fields.


**What This Repository Covers:**

 I implemented and experimented with the following core machine learning algorithms:
  Logistic Regression – binary classification and probability-based decision making,
  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – distance-based classification and sensitivity to noise,
  Support Vector Machine (SVM) – margin-based classification for high-dimensional data,
  Random Forest – ensemble learning and feature importance analysis.
 
**Each notebook focuses on:**
  data preprocessing,
  model training,
  basic evaluation,
  understanding strengths and limitations of the algorithm.

**Datasets Used:**
 To focus on learning algorithms rather than collecting data, I used standard public datasets like
  Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset,
  Titanic Dataset (CSV / TSV),
  Bike Buyers Dataset.
These datasets were chosen only for educational purposes.


**Purpose of This Work**

This repository represents:
  my first structured exposure to machine learning,
  development of analytical thinking and data handling skills.
I consider this work a learning foundation, not a finished or advanced project.
